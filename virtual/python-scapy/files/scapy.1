.SH NAME
scapy \- Interactive packet manipulation tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B scapy
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B scapy
tool.
.PP
\fBscapy\fP is a powerful interactive packet manipulation tool, 
packet generator, network scanner, network discovery, packet sniffer,
etc. It can for the moment replace hping, parts of nmap, arpspoof, arp-sk,
arping, tcpdump, tshark, p0f, ...
.PP
\fBscapy\fP uses the python interpreter as a command board. That means that 
you can use directly python language (assign variables, use loops, 
define functions, etc.) If you give a file as parameter when you run 
\fBscapy\fP, your session (variables, functions, intances, ...) will be saved 
when you leave the interpretor, and restored the next time you launch
\fBscapy\fP. 
.PP
The idea is simple. Those kind of tools do two things : sending packets 
and receiving answers. That's what \fBscapy\fP does : you define a set of 
packets, it sends them, receives answers, matches requests with answers 
and returns a list of packet couples (request, answer) and a list of 
unmatched packets. This has the big advantage over tools like nmap or 
hping that an answer is not reduced to (open/closed/filtered), but is 
the whole packet. 
.PP
On top of this can be build more high level functions, for example one 
that does traceroutes and give as a result only the start TTL of the 
request and the source IP of the answer. One that pings a whole network 
and gives the list of machines answering. One that does a portscan and 
returns a LaTeX report. 

.SH OPTIONS
Options for scapy are:
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
display usage
.TP
\fB\-d\fR
increase log verbosity. Can be used many times.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR FILE
use FILE to save/load session values (variables, functions, intances, ...) 
.TP
\fB\-p\fR PRESTART_FILE 
use PRESTART_FILE instead of $HOME/.scapy_prestart.py as pre-startup file
.TP
\fB\-P\fR
do not run prestart file
.TP
\fB\-c\fR STARTUP_FILE 
use STARTUP_FILE instead of $HOME/.scapy_startup.py as startup file
.TP
\fB\-C\fR
do not run startup file

.SH COMMANDS
Only the vital commands to begin are listed here for the moment.
.TP
\fBls()\fR
lists supported protocol layers. If a protocol layer is given as parameter, lists its fields and types of fields.
.TP
\fBlsc()\fR
lists some user commands. If a command is given as parameter, its documentation is displayed.
.TP
\fBconf\fR
this object contains the configuration. 

.SH FILES
\fB$HOME/.scapy_prestart.py\fR
This file is run before scapy core is loaded. Only the \fb\conf\fP object 
is available. This file can be used to manipulate \fBconf.load_layers\fP 
list to choose which layers will be loaded:

.nf
conf.load_layers.remove("bluetooth")
conf.load_layers.append("new_layer")
.fi

\fB$HOME/.scapy_startup.py\fR
This file is run after scapy is loaded. It can be used to configure
some of the scapy behaviors:

.nf
conf.prog.pdfreader="xpdf"
split_layers(UDP,DNS)
.fi

.SH EXAMPLES

More verbose examples are available at
http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/demo.html
Just run \fBscapy\fP and try the following commands in the interpreter.

.LP
Test the robustness of a network stack with invalid packets:
.nf
sr(IP(dst="172.16.1.1", ihl=2, options="\verb$\x02$", version=3)/ICMP())
.fi

.LP
Packet sniffing and dissection (with a bpf filter or thetereal-like output):
.nf
a=sniff(filter="tcp port 110")
a=sniff(prn = lambda x: x.display) 
.fi

.LP
Sniffed packet reemission:
.nf
a=sniff(filter="tcp port 110")
sendp(a)
.fi

.LP
Pcap file packet reemission:
.nf
sendp(rdpcap("file.cap"))
.fi

.LP
Manual TCP traceroute:
.nf
sr(IP(dst="www.google.com", ttl=(1,30))/TCP(seq=RandInt(), sport=RandShort(), dport=dport)
.fi

.LP
Protocol scan:
.nf
sr(IP(dst="172.16.1.28", proto=(1,254)))
.fi

.LP
ARP ping:
.nf
srp(Ether(dst="ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff")/ARP(pdst="172.16.1.1/24"))
.fi

.LP
ACK scan:
.nf
sr(IP(dst="172.16.1.28")/TCP(dport=(1,1024), flags="A"))
.fi

.LP
Passive OS fingerprinting:
.nf
sniff(prn=prnp0f) 
.fi

.LP
Active OS fingerprinting:
.nf
nmap_fp("172.16.1.232")
.fi


.LP
ARP cache poisonning:
.nf
sendp(Ether(dst=tmac)/ARP(op="who-has", psrc=victim, pdst=target))
.fi

.LP
Reporting:
.nf
report_ports("192.168.2.34", (20,30))
.fi

.SH BUGS
Does not give the right source IP for routes that use interface aliases.

May miss packets under heavy load.

Session saving is limited by Python ability to marshal objects. As a 
consequence, lambda functions and generators can't be saved, which seriously
reduce usefulness of this feature. 

BPF filters don't work on Point-to-point interfaces.
